Hyades is a Supercomputer dedicated to Computational Astrophysics research at University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). It is supported by a million-dollar grant from National Science Foundation (award number AST-1229745) and additional matching funds from UCSC. While the majority of the hardware was procured from Dell in December 2012; further upgrades have substantially augmented Hyades, which saw the addition of a petabyte Huawei cloud storage system as well as a 144TB SuperMicro file server in 2013. Hyades has been serving the Computational Astrophysics community at UCSC since January 2013.
